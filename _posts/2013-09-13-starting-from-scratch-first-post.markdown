In the spirit of starting from scratch, this my first post on my new blog and
portfolio site post [GA WDI] graduation.  I plan to make regular posts of the
things that I learn along the journey to become a legitimate web development
engineer.

I hope you join me on this journey and check-in once in awhile.  I will be
providing commenting capability as I move forward.  Please follow me on
[twitter] and check out my [github] to see what projects I'm working on.
